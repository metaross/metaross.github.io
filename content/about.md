# Michael C Ross

I write about AI platforms, systems thinking, and how we build tools that work with humans rather than around them.

These are explorations, not pronouncements. Notes from the field of trying to make complex systems actually useful.

## Background

I work on AI platform strategy and governance, helping organizations thoughtfully integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows.

## This Site

A home for essays, articles, and writer's notes. Each piece stands alone.
