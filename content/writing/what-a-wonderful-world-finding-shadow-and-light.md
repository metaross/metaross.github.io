The November wind off the Hudson cuts through my jacket as I step off the Weehawken ferry, headphones in, the world narrowed to Armstrong's gravelly voice and the rhythm of my footsteps on the pier.  *Trees of green, red roses too…* The morning commuters rush past—I'm walking slower than usual, letting the song unfold.  By the time I reach the office lobby, the final notes are fading: *And I think to myself, what a wonderful world…*

For over a year in 2023 and 2024, I had this as my alarm.  The song was beautiful enough that I'd stay in bed listening to the whole thing before getting up.  Those extra three minutes became a kind of meditation, a deliberate way to begin each day.  During one of these early morning listenings, I heard something I'd missed my whole life: *the dark sacred night*.

## **The Song That Almost Wasn't**

August 16, 1967, around 2 a.m.  United Recording Studio in Las Vegas.  Louis Armstrong had just finished his midnight show at the Tropicana Hotel.  Arranger Tommy Goodman was working with songwriters Bob Thiele and George David Weiss when ABC Records president Larry Newton burst in.

Newton hated it.  Too slow, too contemplative—he wanted something upbeat like Armstrong's recent hit "Hello, Dolly!"  He tried to stop the session.  The producers physically removed him from the studio and locked the door.  Newton retaliated: he refused to promote the song.  It sold fewer than 1,000 copies in the U.S. initially.

This is the song that almost wasn't—saved only by producers who believed in it enough to literally lock the door against the man who controlled its commercial fate.  The act of defiance was as bold as the song itself: a hymn to beauty in a year of chaos, recorded against orders, then buried by the very label that owned it.

Across the Atlantic, however, the response was dramatically different.  In April 1968, "What a Wonderful World" topped the UK pop chart and became the biggest-selling single of 1968 in Britain , where it stayed at number one for four consecutive weeks.  It wasn't until 1988, when the song was featured in the film *Good Morning, Vietnam*, that American audiences finally embraced it—the reissue reached number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100.

## **Between Two Fires: Louis Armstrong's America**

Louis Armstrong was born August 4, 1901, in a New Orleans neighborhood called "The Battlefield."  He had a fifth-grade education and dropped out to work.  On New Year's Eve 1912, he was arrested and sent to the Colored Waif's Home for Boys—juvenile detention that became the unlikely birthplace of one of music's greatest careers.  Under Peter Davis's tutelage, he learned cornet and became leader of the Waif's Home Brass Band.  In 1922, King Oliver sent for him to join his band in Chicago, launching him into the national jazz scene.  Armstrong's improvised solos transformed jazz from ensemble music into a soloist's art; by the 1920s, his Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings had revolutionized American music.

Armstrong had spent decades smiling, entertaining, staying out of the fray.  February 19, 1957.  Knoxville, Tennessee.  White Citizens Council members threw dynamite at his concert for hiring an integrated band—part of an organized terror campaign that had already bombed Black homes across Tennessee eight times since September.  The explosion was deafening.  Armstrong joked to the crowd, "It's all right, folks, it's just the phone," and kept playing.  When asked if he'd continue touring the South, he said, "Man, I'll play anywhere they'll listen."  Kept smiling.  Kept playing.

Seven months later, something broke.  September 17, 1957.  Little Rock.  Nine Black students trying to integrate Central High School, Governor Orval Faubus sending in the National Guard to stop them, President Eisenhower dithering.  Armstrong—in Grand Forks, North Dakota—gave an interview that had the "explosive effect of an H-bomb."  He called Eisenhower "gutless" and "two-faced."  Called Faubus "an uneducated plow boy."  Said "the government can go to hell" regarding how Black people were being treated in the South.  Then he canceled his State Department-sponsored tour of Russia in protest.  Columnist Drew Pearson later credited Armstrong with changing Eisenhower's mind—a week later, the 101st Airborne rolled into Little Rock.

The backlash came from all sides.  The FBI opened a file on him.  But the worst came from the Black community: "Uncle Tom," "handkerchief head," "old-fashioned."  Younger jazz musicians—Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Amiri Baraka—viewed him as a relic.  The Black Power movement called him "The No. 1 Uncle Tom."  Hurt and cautioned by his manager, Armstrong went mostly silent on race through the 1960s.  When pressed, he'd say, "I don't get involved in politics.  I just blow my horn."  But he was well aware of the accusations, and they angered him greatly.

March 7, 1965.  Selma.  Bloody Sunday.  Armstrong was in Denmark, watching the televised beatings, and became physically ill.  He turned his old number "Black and Blue" into a protest song he'd play for the rest of his life.

This is the man Thiele and Weiss wrote "What a Wonderful World" for in 1967.  Ten years after Little Rock.  Two years after Selma.  Caught between being called an Uncle Tom and being surveilled by the FBI.  Publicly silent but privately wrestling with race in America—after his death, his tape recordings revealed an Armstrong far more "complex, deep thinking, and Black-minded than the person he portrayed on stage."  He was 66 years old during that late-night Las Vegas session, his voice weathered by decades of touring, his body failing (first heart attack in 1959, back in intensive care for heart and kidney trouble in 1968, just months after recording this song).  And young people were asking him, "Hey, Pops—what do you mean, what a wonderful world?"

He passed away in his sleep on July 6, 1971, a few months after his final engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria.  When he sang about a wonderful world, he knew exactly what world he was living in.

## **The Songwriter and the Artist**

The song was written in 1967 by Bob Thiele (under the pseudonym George Douglas) and George David Weiss, specifically composed with Louis Armstrong in mind.  Thiele explained their motivation: "In the mid-1960s during the deepening national traumas of the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, racial strife, and turmoil everywhere, my co-writer George David Weiss and I had an idea to write a 'different' song specifically for Louis Armstrong" .

George Weiss said he wrote the song for Armstrong because he was inspired by Armstrong's ability to bring together people of different races.  The songwriters wanted to create an antidote to the chaos—not a protest song, but a hymn to everyday beauty that acknowledged darkness while choosing to celebrate light.

When Armstrong read the lyrics, his mood changed immediately because the words made him think of his home in Corona, Queens: "There's so much in 'Wonderful World' that brings me back to my neighborhood where I live in Corona, New York" .

But what did the first draft look like?  Songwriting rarely emerges fully formed.  Did early versions have different imagery?  More abstract language that got simplified?  Verses that didn't make the cut?  The Louis Armstrong House Museum in Corona—the home where Armstrong lived from 1943 until his death—holds thousands of documents, recordings, and personal papers in its archives.  Bob Thiele's papers might contain original lyric sheets, session notes, or correspondence about the song's development.

And here's the more interesting question: Did Armstrong shape the words during recording?  Jazz musicians improvise; Armstrong revolutionized vocal phrasing by treating his voice like his trumpet.  When he sang this at 2 a.m. in that Las Vegas studio, did he change a word here, adjust a rhythm there, make it his own in ways that became canonical?

If earlier drafts exist in the archives, they'd reveal something crucial: whether the song's childlike simplicity was the initial instinct or a hard-won distillation.  Whether certain striking phrasings were there from the start or emerged in revision.  Whether Armstrong's interpretation locked in certain words and rhythms that weren't originally set in stone.

The difference between a first draft and a final version is the difference between an idea and an artifact.  For a song this carefully crafted yet this seemingly simple, the evolution matters.^1^

## **The Song Itself**

Trees of green, red roses, skies of blue, clouds of white.  Simple observations, primary colors.  But Armstrong's voice makes them profound.

But then there's *the dark sacred night*.

I'd listened for over a year.  Then one morning in bed, it hit.  Not just there—*there*.  It brings shadow into a song otherwise filled with light—and the darkness isn't something to fear or overcome.  It's *sacred*.  Not "blessed" like the bright day, but *sacred*—set apart, holy, worthy of reverence.  Wonder exists in shadow as well as light, in mystery as well as clarity, not just in the dawn but also in the close of day.

And then: "I watch them grow.  They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world."  As someone driven by curiosity, reaching an age where mortality feels closer, the prospect of not being around to learn everything carries weight.  But Armstrong reframes it: isn't it wonderful that today's children will get to learn what you won't?  Loss becomes hope.

This is Armstrong at 66, with a failing heart, looking at the future he won't see—and finding it wonderful.  Not despite his absence, but *because* life continues, because knowledge accumulates, because each generation gets to discover anew.  It's the opposite of the bitter "kids these days" lament.  It's radical generosity.

## **Lovely Days and Diamond Skies**

1967 offered two paths to wonder.  Two weeks before Armstrong recorded this song, Pink Floyd released *The Piper at the Gates of Dawn*—Syd Barrett singing about gnomes named Grimble Gromble, the Beatles floating "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," the counterculture discovering LSD to "regain innocent vision" and strip away adult habits of seeing.  Armstrong didn't need acid to see trees of green as miraculous.  He just looked at his neighborhood in Corona, Queens.  When young people said, "Hey, Pops—what do you mean, what a wonderful world?" they were taking psychedelics to achieve what he'd already found through unaltered observation.  Diamond skies through chemistry, lovely days through attention.

**Israel Kamakawiwoʻole's 1993 medley**, recorded after *Good Morning, Vietnam* reawakened American audiences to Armstrong's song, paired "What a Wonderful World" with "Over the Rainbow"—as if to say: the wonderful world and the place we dream of are the same place, if we'd just look.

## **Sacred Shadows**

Bob Thiele produced *A Love Supreme* two years before this—Coltrane's spiritual jazz as prayer.  Then he wrote about finding the sacred through simple observation.  Trees of green, skies of blue, *the dark sacred night*.

That last phrase is where the song stops being merely optimistic.  Not light triumphing over darkness, but darkness itself as worthy of reverence.  Armstrong's catalog of simple things (roses, babies, handshakes) insists the night is just as sacred as the blessed day.

And there's the choice.  Armstrong chose to sing beauty in the summer of 1967.  Detroit had burned in July.  Newark had burned in July.  His body was failing.  Everything pointed toward chaos.  He recorded this anyway.  The song acknowledges mortality (babies will "learn much more than I'll ever know"), celebrates continuity despite his absence.  It's Camus's Sisyphus finding joy in the endless task.  Selective attention that isn't denial—you're choosing where to rest your gaze within a world that contains both.

*I settle into my desk. The song has ended, but the pier walk stays with me—that slower pace, the deliberate attention. My computer screen wakes up: emails, deadlines, fires to put out. Everything that makes you ask, "What do you mean, what a wonderful world?" Outside the window, November has stripped the trees bare. No green, no roses. The sky isn't blue—it's that flat November gray that sits over the Hudson like a lid. But I've already chosen where to look this morning. Not the only place. Just the first place. It's enough to start the day.*
