# Hi, I'm Michael.

I work on AI platform strategy and governance, helping organizations thoughtfully integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows.

I'm fascinated by how we can build systems that amplify human capability without losing the human element. When I'm not thinking about AI architecture, I'm usually tinkering with new tools, reading about systems thinking, or exploring how people organize knowledge.

## What I'm interested in

- Making AI platforms actually useful (not just impressive)
- Workflow automation that doesn't break
- Knowledge management systems that work the way humans think
- Building tools that get out of your way

This site is where I share notes, thoughts, and things I'm learning.
